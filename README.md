# EarlyUser Mailer

**EarlyUser Mailer** is a simple tool used internally at TailTag to send emails to early users, offering them free lifetime access to our premium subscription, **TailTag Pro**. This utility leverages **Nodemailer** and **Gmail SMTP** to handle email sending tasks. It's designed to be a straightforward, customizable way to distribute important messages to a list of recipients which we automatically get from our Supabase backend (based on criteria such as creation date, current subscription status, and other).

## Features

- Get users from our Supabase backend automatically
- Check their creation time & subscription state
- Send personalized emails to multiple recipients.
- Easily configure email content and recipient list.
- Built-in support for HTML content in emails.
- Uses **Gmail SMTP** for email delivery.
- Simple and lightweight.

## Installation

To get started with **EarlyUser Mailer**, you'll need to clone the repository and set up your environment. Follow the steps below to install and configure the project.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tailtag/earlyuser-mailer.git
   cd earlyuser-mailer
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholders with your Gmail credentials:

   ```env
    GMAIL_USER=gmail-user-here
    GMAIL_PASS=gmail-pass-here
    SEND_AS_EMAIL=-send-as-email-here
    SUPABASE_URL=supabase-url-here
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eservice-key-here
   ```

5. Set up your configuration file (`src/config.ts`) with the recipients, subject, and HTML content of the email.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

In order to send emails, you need to configure the environment variables in the `.env` file.

- **GMAIL_USER**: Your Gmail username (email address).
- **GMAIL_PASS**: The password for the Gmail account (or an App Password if you have 2FA enabled).
- **SEND_AS_EMAIL**: The email address that will be used as the "from" address when sending the email (this can be the same as `GMAIL_USER`).
- **SUPABASE_URL**: URL of your supabase instance
- **SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY**: Service role key from supabase
  Example of `.env`:

```env
GMAIL_USER=gmail-user-here
GMAIL_PASS=gmail-pass-here
SEND_AS_EMAIL=-send-as-email-here
SUPABASE_URL=supabase-url-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eservice-key-here
```

### Configuration File

The `src/config.ts` file is where you configure the email content.

- **subject**: The subject line of the email.
- **htmlContent**: The HTML content of the email.

Example of `src/config.ts`:

```typescript
const subject = "Welcome to TailTag Pro!"; // Subject of the email
const htmlContent = `
  <h1>Welcome to TailTag Pro!</h1>
  <p>Enjoy your lifetime free access to TailTag Pro features.</p>
`; // HTML content of your email

export { subject, htmlContent };
```

## Usage

### Send Emails

After configuring the `.env` file and `config.ts`, you can send the email to all recipients by running the following command:

```bash
npm run send
# What this does is just to run npx tsx src/index.ts
```

This will initiate the email sending process, using the provided email content and recipient list. Each recipient will receive the email in their inbox.

---

## How It Works

1. **Environment Setup**: The tool loads your Gmail credentials and the email "from" address from the `.env` file. It uses these credentials to authenticate with Gmail's SMTP service.
2. **Configuration**: The email content (subject and HTML body) and recipient list are set up in `src/config.ts`.
3. **Getting Recipients**: Connect to the Supabase to get users, sort them by specefic criteria to get out recepient list.
4. **Sending Emails**: The tool uses Nodemailer to send the email. It loops through the recipient list, sending each one the same email with the configured subject and HTML content.

The `sendEmailsToRecipients` function calls `sendEmail`, which in turn uses Gmail's SMTP service to send the email.
